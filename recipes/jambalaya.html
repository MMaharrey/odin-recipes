    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Brad Leone knocked it out of the park, or should we say "took us out on a hike with this dish"
        Brad's recipe is a perfect one pot recipe that is perfect for a fall camping trip. This dish 
        has that classic creole flavor with a special Leone style we all love. "Editors note, If you
        decide to make this best jambalaya recipe out in the wild, pack the perishables in a cooler."

        <li>4 celery stalks, chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>

        <li>2 cups long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Creole seasoning</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>6 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>¾ pound medium shrimp, peeled, deveined</li>
        <li>Handful of fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves with tender stems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare grill for high heat. Heat oil in a large wok or skillet set directly on grate.
            (If cooking indoors, place over high heat.) Add chicken and sausage; season with salt 
            and pepper. Cook, turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until softened, 
            about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until it begins to darken, about 
            2 minutes. Mix in tomatoes, scraping up browned bits, then mix in rice, seasoning, and
            bay leaves. Add broth; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil.</li>

        <li>Move wok to a cooler spot (or reduce heat), cover with foil, and simmer until almost 
            all liquid is absorbed, 20-30 minutes.</li>
            
        <li>Season shrimp with salt and pepper; mix into rice. Cover and cook until rice is tender
            and shrimp are cooked through, 5-8 minutes. Top with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
