<h3>Description</h3>
<p> A truly wonderful drink that will get a lot of comments from those who may not be familiar with it. 
    A definite party maker!Growing up with a Swedish family this was a staple of Christmas, the smell 
    is so sweet and wonderful. This is exactly how my father makes it. Be prepared though for the 
    kick and don't expect to drink too much!

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>Serves 60</p>
<ul>
    <li>5 (750 milliliter) bottles port wine</li>
    <li>1 (750 milliliter) bottle 100 proof bourbon whiskey</li>
    <li>1 (750 milliliter) bottle white rum</li>
    <li>3 whole cardamom pods, cracked</li>
    <li>1 small cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>4 whole cloves</li>
    <li>1 (3 inch) strip of orange peel</li>
    <li>1 (8 inch) square of cheesecloth</li>
    <li>Â¾ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) package dark raisins</li>
    <li>1 (6 ounce) package blanched slivered almonds</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the port wine over medium heat until just below the simmer point in a large stockpot 
        with a lid. Add bourbon and rum, and bring back to just below simmering. Save the bottles 
        and their caps for storing leftover glogg.</li>
    <li>While the wine and liquors are heating, place the cardamom, cinnamon stick, cloves, and 
        orange peel onto the center of the square of cheesecloth. Gather together the edges of 
        the cheesecloth, and tie with kitchen twine to secure.</li>
    <li>When mixture is very hot but not boiling, carefully light it with a long-handled match.
        Wearing a heatproof cooking mitt, carefully pour the sugar into the flames, and let the 
        mixture burn for 1 minute. Put the lid on the stockpot to extinguish the flames, and 
        turn off the heat. Let the mixture cool, covered, for about 10 minutes; add the cheesecloth 
        bundle of spices and the raisins and almonds to the warm wine mixture and let it cool to 
        room temperature, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Strain the cooled glogg and reserve the raisins and almonds.</li>
    <li>To store, pour strained glogg into the bottles, recap, and keep upright in a cool dark 
        place for up to 1 year. Refrigerate the steeped raisins and almonds in a covered bowl 
        or jar for up to 1 year.</li>
    <li>To serve, pour glogg into a saucepan and warm over low-medium heat until hot but not 
        simmering, about 5 minutes. Ladle 3 ounces of warmed glogg into a small coffee cup 
        or small Swedish-style glogg mug, and garnish each serving with a few reserved 
        raisins and almonds.</li>
</ol>
